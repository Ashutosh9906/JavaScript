            Mīmāṁsā (Sanskrit: मीमांसा; IAST: Mīmāṃsā) is a term derived from Sanskrit, meaning "reflection" or "critical examination." It represents a school of Hindu philosophy that primarily focuses on interpreting and analyzing Vedic texts, particularly the sections dealing with rituals and rites. Known as Pūrva-Mīmāṁsā ("Earlier Mīmāṁsā") or Karma-Mīmāṁsā ("Mīmāṁsā of Action"), this school is one of the six āstika (Veda-affirming) schools of Indian philosophy. Mīmāṁsā is notable for its exploration of Dharma (duty and ethical conduct) as derived from the Vedas, specifically the Brāhmaṇas and Saṃhitās.

Mīmāṁsā is traditionally divided into two main sub-schools. The Prabhākara sub-school, named after the philosopher Prabhākara, identifies five reliable means (pramāṇas) for acquiring knowledge: perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), comparison (upamāṇa), postulation (arthāpatti), and verbal testimony (śabda). The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, established by Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, adds a sixth method called anupalabdhi, which refers to knowledge derived from non-perception, such as understanding absence or lack.

Although Mīmāṁsā addresses spiritual concepts, it places minimal emphasis on the existence of deities. Instead, it defines Dharma primarily in terms of ritual actions and social duties. Mīmāṁsakas regard the Vedas as eternal, authorless, and infallible texts, with ritual practices and mantras viewed as the highest expression of Dharma. In their perspective, the Upanishads—texts focused on self-knowledge and spirituality—are considered secondary in importance.

The school’s approach to language is another distinctive aspect, emphasizing that the primary purpose of language is to convey clear prescriptions for proper conduct. This view contrasts with the Vedānta school, which expands the purpose of language to include metaphysical and philosophical exploration.

Mīmāṁsā is a form of philosophical realism and is fundamentally grounded in the belief that a regulated, duty-bound life is the highest purpose of Dharma. Its foundational text is the Mīmāṁsā Sūtra of Jaimini.

Vedanta, another of the six main schools of Hindu philosophy, is so named because it is derived from the "end of the Veda" (Veda-anta). It is primarily concerned with the teachings found in the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutra of Bādarāyaṇa, and the Bhagavad Gita, collectively known as the Prasthanatrayi.

Vedanta is centered on the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality, and holds that the individual soul (Atman) is fundamentally identical to Brahman. This philosophy asserts that the perception of a separate, material world (Maya) is an illusion, and true knowledge is the realization of the oneness of Atman and Brahman. Salvation (moksha) is achieved through this realization, which leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Vedanta has several sub-schools, including Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), and Dvaita (dualism), each offering a different interpretation of the relationship between Atman and Brahman. Despite these variations, all Vedanta philosophies share a common emphasis on the pursuit of self-knowledge as the highest spiritual goal.
