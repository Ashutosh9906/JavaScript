            Buddhism, also known as Buddhadharma and Dharmavinaya, is a spiritual and philosophical tradition that originated in ancient India, based on the teachings of the Buddha, a wandering sage who lived during the 6th or 5th century BCE. It is recognized as the world's fourth-largest religion, with an estimated following of nearly 500 million practitioners globally, who are known as Buddhists, making up about seven percent of the world’s population.

Emerging in the eastern Gangetic plains around the 5th century BCE as part of the śramaṇa tradition, Buddhism expanded gradually across much of Asia and eventually reached the West during the 20th century, becoming a significant influence on global spirituality and culture.

Central to Buddhism are the teachings of the Buddha, who guided his followers towards a path of spiritual development aimed at attaining awakening and ultimate liberation from suffering (dukkha). His teachings emphasized a balanced approach, known as the Middle Way, which avoids the extremes of severe asceticism and indulgence in sensory pleasures. The Buddha’s core teachings include the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and key concepts such as dependent origination, karma, and the three marks of existence. Additional foundational practices involve veneration of the Triple Gem, adherence to ethical precepts, and the cultivation of spiritual perfections (pāramitā).

Buddhist scriptures are extensive and exist in numerous collections written in various languages, including Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, and Chinese. The interpretation of these teachings varies among the different schools, leading to a diverse array of philosophical doctrines and spiritual practices.

Buddhism is generally categorized into two main branches: Theravāda ("School of the Elders") and Mahāyāna ("Great Vehicle"). Theravāda, prominent in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia), emphasizes attaining nirvāṇa, a state of liberation from the cycle of birth and death (saṃsāra). In contrast, Mahāyāna, which encompasses traditions such as Tiantai, Chan, Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren, and Tendai, is practiced in East Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and highlights the Bodhisattva path of seeking enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.

A further form, Vajrayāna ("Indestructible Vehicle"), which incorporates esoteric tantric teachings, is sometimes viewed as a separate branch within Mahāyāna. It is primarily associated with Tibetan Buddhism and is practiced in the Himalayan regions, Mongolia, and parts of Russia such as Kalmykia and Tuva, with Japanese Shingon maintaining a Vajrayāna lineage in East Asia.

Historically, Buddhism was widely practiced across the Indian subcontinent until its decline around the early 2nd millennium. It also had a notable presence in regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Despite this historical decline in its birthplace, Buddhism continues to have a profound impact on spiritual, cultural, and philosophical traditions across Asia and the world.
