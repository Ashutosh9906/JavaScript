            Vaisheshika (IAST: Vaiśeṣika; /vaɪˈʃɛʃɪkə/; Sanskrit: वैशेषिक) is one of the six foundational schools of Hindu philosophy originating in ancient India. Initially, Vaiśeṣika was an independent philosophical system with its own distinctive theories of metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, and the path to liberation (soteriology). Over time, it became closely associated with the Nyāya school, sharing similar approaches to logic, ethics, and spiritual liberation, but maintaining unique perspectives on epistemology and metaphysics.

The epistemology of Vaiśeṣika is characterized by the acceptance of two reliable sources of knowledge: direct perception (pratyakṣa) and inference (anumāṇa). This is similar to the approach of Buddhism, which also emphasizes these two means of knowledge. However, a key difference is that while Buddhism relies on its own canonical texts, Vaiśeṣika considers the Vedas as authoritative scripture, making it an āstika (Veda-affirming) school of thought.

Vaiśeṣika is best known for its contributions to naturalism and atomism within Indian philosophy. It proposes that all physical objects are composed of fundamental particles called paramāṇu (atoms). These atoms combine in various ways to form the material world, and the qualities of objects emerge from the specific arrangement and interactions of these atoms. The school identifies six categories (padārtha) to explain reality: substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity, and inherence. These categories serve as the foundation for understanding the nature of existence and experience.

According to Vaiśeṣika, true knowledge and spiritual liberation are achieved through a comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality. This philosophy is attributed to the sage Kaṇāda Kashyapa, who is believed to have founded the school between the 6th and 2nd centuries BCE.

Nyaya, another major school of Hindu philosophy, was founded by the sage Gautama, who is also known as Aksapada. Sometimes referred to as the Aksapada system, Nyaya is primarily focused on the study of knowledge (pramāṇa) and logic, earning it the titles Nyaya Vidya (the science of logic) and Tarka Sastra (the science of reasoning).

Nyaya philosophy is a detailed exploration of the nature, sources, and validity of knowledge. It is also known as anviksiki, which means “the science of critical investigation.” Nyaya provides a systematic method for distinguishing true knowledge from false knowledge, using tools such as perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony as reliable sources of knowledge.

In Nyaya, liberation (moksha) is achieved through the attainment of true knowledge, which is gained by applying logical analysis and critical reasoning. The school emphasizes that accurate understanding of reality is essential for overcoming ignorance and attaining spiritual freedom.
