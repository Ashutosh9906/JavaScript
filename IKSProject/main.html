        <p>
            Āstika (Sanskrit: आस्तिक; [ɑst̪ɪkᵊ], IAST: Āstika) and Nāstika (Sanskrit: नास्तिक; [n̪ɑst̪ɪkᵊ], IAST: Nāstika) are two contrasting terms that scholars use to categorize Indian philosophical traditions, as well as certain Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts. The interpretation of these terms has been a subject of debate since ancient times, and there is no universal agreement on their definitions.
    
    Traditionally, one common approach in ancient and medieval Sanskrit philosophical literature is to describe āstika schools as those that acknowledge the Vedas—the ancient sacred texts of India—as an authoritative source, while nāstika schools are identified as those that reject the authority of the Vedas. However, in modern Indian languages like Telugu, Hindi, and Bengali, these terms have evolved to generally signify 'theist' (āstika) and 'atheist' (nāstika). Despite this evolution, the original philosophical distinction is maintained. For example, Sāṃkhya—a school that does not explicitly affirm the existence of a deity in its classical form—is still categorized as an āstika philosophy because it accepts the Vedas. In contrast, Buddhism is categorized as nāstika due to its rejection of Vedic authority, even though some Hindu traditions consider Gautama Buddha an avatar of Vishnu.
    
    The term āstika is derived from the Sanskrit root 'asti', meaning 'there is' or 'there exists'. It has been defined in three main ways: as those who acknowledge the Vedas as a source of knowledge, those who affirm the existence of ātman (the self), and those who accept the existence of Ishvara (a supreme being). On the other hand, nāstika is derived from 'na' (not) + 'āstika', and generally describes those who deny any of these three principles, including the existence of the self.
    
    Indian philosophical traditions are broadly categorized into six prominent āstika schools—Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedānta—and five major nāstika schools—Buddhism, Jainism, Chārvāka, Ājīvika, and Ajñana. These categories are often referred to as orthodox (āstika) and heterodox (nāstika) schools, but this terminology is primarily a product of Western scholarship and is not rooted in the Sanskrit tradition itself. Scholars have pointed out that many modern interpretations of āstika and nāstika in 20th-century literature are oversimplified and often misleading, lacking the depth of traditional philosophical discourse.
